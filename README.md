Power and Data Tranfer (PDI)
Two identical PCB's are being used for testing. The schematic PDI_v1 is of one PCB.
The sizing of passive components is as follows - 
1) Rlim - 42.2kΩ
2) CdVdT = 2.2nF
3) R(IMON) = 43kΩ
4) C1 - 100-nF to 220-nF decoupling capacitors
5) R5 ,R6-  Use 1-kΩ to 10-kΩ pull-up and pull-down resistors for enable lines to limit noise currents in theses lines during transient events.
6) R7,R8 -10Ω
7) R2 = 120

The rationale for sizing is given in the document -https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z6xQF2i3oRSEwMOCmPyrtTIQfxgxBp68ftvw1PFQKHI/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.l0r2exo0l2pc
